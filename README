Wordsearch generator
====================

Currently, this is a simple command-line script which generates a wordsearch
grid.

Usage:

 python3 wordsearch.py <difficulty> [word...]

The grid size, and permissible directions for words, is controlled by the
difficulty setting, which is one of easy, normal and hard.

The output grid is displayed on stdout.

Much word still remains to make the output nice.
